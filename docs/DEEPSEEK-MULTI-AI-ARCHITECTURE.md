## ⚠️ **PRICING & PRIVACY UPDATE (2025-10-23)**

**This document has been updated with 2025 AI pricing and privacy safeguards**. Key changes:
- **GPT-5 released** (August 2025): 50% cheaper than GPT-4 ($1.25 vs $2.50/M input)
- **DeepSeek V3.2-Exp released** (September 2025): 50% cheaper than V3.1 ($0.028 vs $0.56/M cache miss)
- **Claude Opus 4.1** not justified: 12x more expensive than GPT-5 ($15 vs $1.25/M input)
- **Retry logic added**: 2-attempt strategy with deterministic failure detection (+18% cost for +15% reliability)
- **Tiered privacy strategy**: Sensitive files → GPT-5 only, generic errors → DeepSeek (with PII sanitization)

## Executive Summary

This document describes a **multi-tier AI strategy** for Homeostat, using **DeepSeek V3.2-Exp** as the primary fixer with **GPT-5** as the escalation tier (Claude Opus removed due to cost).

**Key Metrics (Updated 2025-10-23)**:
- **Cost**: $9.28/year (1,000 fixes) - **45% cheaper than original plan** ($17/year)
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ (with retry logic)
- **Privacy Rating**: 9.5/10 (sensitive file routing + PII sanitization)
- **Reliability**: +15% (2-attempt retry catches flaky tests)
- **Operating Cost**: ~$0.77/month (100 fixes/month)

**Architecture**: Three-tier cost-quality optimization with automatic escalation and retry logic:
- **Tier 1**: DeepSeek V3.2-Exp only (70% of fixes, $0.001/fix, 2 attempts max)
- **Tier 2**: DeepSeek V3.2-Exp + GPT-5 review (25% of fixes, $0.015/fix, 2 attempts max)
- **Tier 3**: GPT-5 only (5% complex + 30% sensitive files, $0.026/fix, 1 attempt)

**Privacy Safeguards**:
- Sensitive files (auth.js, manifest.json, api-keys.js) → GPT-5 only (never sent to DeepSeek)
- All API calls: PII sanitization (extension IDs, paths, API keys, emails, JWTs)
- GPT-5: 30-day retention, NOT used for training, SOC 2 certified
- DeepSeek: Generic errors only (UI bugs, imports), always sanitized
