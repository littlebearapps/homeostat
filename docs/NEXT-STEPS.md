# Homeostat - Next Steps

**Status**: High-priority enhancements complete, ready for testing and deployment
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24

---

## 🧪 Phase 1: Testing New Features (1-2 hours)

### Test Multi-Repository Orchestration

**Objective**: Validate central workflow can process multiple repos

- [ ] Run local orchestrator test
  ```bash
  npm test -- tests/e2e/multi-repo-workflow.test.ts
  # Expected: All multi-repo tests passing
  ```

- [ ] Verify repos.yml configuration
  ```bash
  cat .homeostat/repos.yml
  # Expected: 3 repos configured (convert-my-file, notebridge, palette-kit)
  ```

- [ ] Test RepoManager manually (optional)
  ```bash
  npm test -- tests/unit/multi-repo/repo-manager.test.ts
  ```

---

### Test Self-Healing Feature Flags

**Objective**: Confirm pattern extraction respects `HOMEOSTAT_ENV`

- [ ] Verify dev mode disables pattern extraction
  ```bash
  HOMEOSTAT_ENV=dev npm test -- tests/e2e/self-healing-feature-flags.test.ts
  # Expected: Pattern extraction returns null in dev
  ```

- [ ] Verify production mode enables pattern extraction
  ```bash
  HOMEOSTAT_ENV=production npm test -- tests/e2e/self-healing-feature-flags.test.ts
  # Expected: Pattern extraction works in production
  ```

- [ ] Check pattern library is empty (ready for production growth)
  ```bash
  cat shared/patterns/library.json
  # Expected: Empty patterns array, version: 1
  ```

---

### Test Observability & Telemetry

**Objective**: Validate JSONL logging and PR templates work

- [ ] Run telemetry tests
  ```bash
  npm test -- tests/unit/telemetry/jsonl-logger.test.ts
  # Expected: JSONL artifacts created correctly
  ```

- [ ] Verify PR template generation
  ```bash
  npm test -- tests/unit/templates/pr-template.test.ts
  # Expected: Templates include fingerprint, state, opt-out
  ```

- [ ] Check GitHub Actions workflow syntax
  ```bash
  cat .github/workflows/multi-repo-orchestrator.yml | grep HOMEOSTAT_ENV
  # Expected: HOMEOSTAT_ENV: production
  ```

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: Production Deployment (2-3 hours)

**See**: `docs/REMAINING-TASKS.md` for complete deployment checklist

### Quick Deployment Summary

1. **Verify CloakPipe Ready** - Check Phase 3 complete in cloakpipe repo
2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** - Add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Convert My File repo
3. **Deploy Multi-Repo Workflow** - Already done (in Homeostat repo)
4. **Test with First Error** - Wait for CloakPipe to create issue with `robot` label
5. **Monitor Pattern Growth** - Watch `shared/patterns/library.json` grow over time

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (depending on error rate from CloakPipe)

---

## 🔍 Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation (Ongoing)

### Week 1: Monitor First Fixes

- [ ] Check first automated fix PR
  - **Location**: GitHub → convert-my-file → Pull Requests
  - **Expected**: PR created with fingerprint in description

- [ ] Verify pattern library starts growing
  ```bash
  cat shared/patterns/library.json | jq '.patterns | length'
  # Expected: Gradually increases from 0
  ```

- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions summaries
  - **Location**: GitHub → homeostat → Actions → Multi-Repo Homeostat
  - **Expected**: Per-repo metrics, cost tracking, pattern usage

- [ ] Check JSONL artifacts
  ```bash
  ls -la artifacts/
  # Expected: run-*.jsonl files created every 6 hours
  ```

---

### Week 2-4: Pattern Learning Validation

- [ ] Verify first zero-cost fix (pattern replay)
  - **Expected**: PR created without AI cost when pattern confidence >80%

- [ ] Check pattern success rates
  ```bash
  cat shared/patterns/library.json | jq '.patterns[] | {id, successRate}'
  # Expected: Success rates updating based on PR outcomes
  ```

- [ ] Monitor cooldown effectiveness
  ```bash
  cat .homeostat/attempt-store.json | jq 'map(select(.cooldownUntil != null))'
  # Expected: <5% of fingerprints in cooldown
  ```

---

### Month 1-6: Long-Term Metrics

- [ ] **Multi-repo efficiency**: 1 workflow update vs 3 = 66% time savings ✅
- [ ] **Fingerprinting accuracy**: >95% duplicate errors → same fingerprint
- [ ] **Cooldown effectiveness**: <5% of fingerprints hit max attempts
- [ ] **Pattern library growth**: 10-50 patterns (depends on error diversity)
- [ ] **Cost savings**: Pattern replays reduce AI spend by 20-40%

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Optional Enhancements (Future)

**See**: `docs/FUTURE-ENHANCEMENTS.md` for complete list

### High-Value, Low-Effort Enhancements

These are **already implemented** or **deferred** with good reason:

- ✅ **Slack Integration** - Implemented (feature-flag controlled)
- ✅ **Metrics Dashboard** - Implemented (GitHub Actions summaries + JSONL)
- ⏳ **Canary Deployment** - Deferred until 100+ fixes (low ROI now)
- ⏳ **Incremental Rollout** - Deferred until 3+ extensions (not needed yet)

### Potential Future Enhancements

**Only implement if production data shows need**:

1. **Advanced Pattern Matching** (if simple patterns insufficient)
   - Fuzzy matching beyond exact fingerprints
   - Pattern clustering for similar errors
   - **Effort**: 4-6 hours
   - **Wait until**: 6+ months production data

2. **Cost Optimization** (if budget exceeded)
   - Dynamic tier selection based on pattern library
   - Batch processing for low-priority fixes
   - **Effort**: 3-4 hours
   - **Wait until**: Monthly cost >$2

3. **Multi-Language Support** (if expanding beyond Chrome extensions)
   - Python/Go/Rust error parsing
   - Language-specific fingerprinting
   - **Effort**: 6-8 hours
   - **Wait until**: Non-JS extension needed

## 📊 Success Criteria

**Before declaring "production ready"**:

- [x] All 193 base tests passing (Phase 0-1 + P0-P6)
- [x] All 19 new tests passing (multi-repo + self-healing + observability)
- [x] Feature flag system validated (dev/test/production modes)
- [x] Documentation complete (CLAUDE.md, README.md, integration docs)
- [ ] First successful automated fix in Convert My File
- [ ] First zero-cost pattern replay (week 2-4)
- [ ] Cost under $9.28/year target (validate after month 1)

## 🎯 Current Priority

**Next action**: Deploy to Convert My File (see `docs/REMAINING-TASKS.md`)

**Blockers**:
- CloakPipe integration must be complete (Phase 3)
- Convert My File repo needs GitHub Secrets configured

**Timeline**: Ready to deploy within 2-3 days when CloakPipe is ready
