## Question 1: GitHub Actions Cost Scaling

**Your question**: "please find the github pricing relevant to this and do some maths/estimations of costs as we scale (note: the littlebearapps git org is paying for 2x "Team" subscription licenses per month - does this help us for these plans?)"

### Answer: ‚úÖ Team Plan Provides Excellent Value

**GitHub Team Subscription Benefits**:
- **Actions minutes**: 3,000 minutes/month (50% more than Free tier's 2,000)
- **Cost**: $4/user/month (already paying for 2 users = $96/year)
- **Overage rate**: $0.008/minute

**Cost Scaling Projections**:

| Fixes/Month | Minutes Used | % of Quota | Overage Cost | Total/Year |
|-------------|--------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 10 fixes | 35 min | 1.2% | $0 | **FREE** |
| 100 fixes | 350 min | 11.7% | $0 | **FREE** |
| 500 fixes | 1,750 min | 58.3% | $0 | **FREE** |
| 857 fixes | 3,000 min | 100% | $0 | **FREE** (break-even) |
| 1,000 fixes | 3,500 min | 116.7% | $4/month | **$48/year** |
| 5,000 fixes | 17,500 min | 583.3% | $116/month | **$1,392/year** |

**Realistic Usage** (based on 3 extensions, ~300 active users):
- Expected: **10-100 fixes/month** = 1-12% of quota
- Verdict: **100% FREE** for foreseeable future

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions on Team plan is optimal** (no changes needed)

## Question 2: Tier Escalation Gating

**Your question**: "is this appropriately 'gated' for escalations? E.g., tier 1 & 2 won't just fail once each and then escalate to tier 3, will they? Please investigate what is appropriate"

### Answer: ‚ö†Ô∏è Single-Failure Escalation Too Aggressive

**Current (Implied) Behavior**:
```
Tier 1 fails once ‚Üí immediate escalate to Tier 2
Tier 2 fails once ‚Üí immediate escalate to Tier 3
Tier 3 fails once ‚Üí alert human
```

**Problem**: Wastes GPT-5 budget on:
- Flaky tests (non-deterministic failures)
- Transient errors (network timeouts, race conditions)
- AI "bad luck" (first attempt unlucky, second would succeed)

**RECOMMENDED: 2-Attempt Retry with Deterministic Detection**

### Implementation

```javascript
async function attemptFixWithRetries(tier, error, maxAttempts = 2) {
  let attempts = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < maxAttempts; i++) {
    const result = await attemptFix(tier.model, error, {
      temperature: i === 0 ? 0.7 : 0.3,  // Lower temp on retry
      previousAttempts: attempts
    });

    attempts.push(result);

    // Success ‚Üí return immediately
    if (result.testsPassed) {
      return { success: true, result, attempts };
    }

    // Same error twice ‚Üí deterministic failure, escalate
    if (i > 0 && isSameError(attempts[i-1], result)) {
      return {
        success: false,
        shouldEscalate: true,
        reason: 'deterministic_failure',
        attempts
      };
    }
  }

  // Max retries exhausted ‚Üí escalate
  return {
    success: false,
    shouldEscalate: true,
    reason: 'max_retries_exceeded',
    attempts
  };
}

function isSameError(attempt1, attempt2) {
  // Extract error messages from test output
  const error1 = attempt1.testOutput.match(/Error: (.*)/)?.[1];
  const error2 = attempt2.testOutput.match(/Error: (.*)/)?.[1];

  if (!error1 || !error2) return false;

  // Use Levenshtein distance for similarity
  const distance = levenshtein(error1, error2);
  const maxLength = Math.max(error1.length, error2.length);

  // <10% difference ‚Üí same error
  return distance / maxLength < 0.1;
}
```

### Parameters

- **Tier 1 (DeepSeek)**: 2 attempts max
- **Tier 2 (DeepSeek + GPT-5)**: 2 attempts max
- **Tier 3 (GPT-5)**: 1 attempt only (human escalation if fails)

### Cost Analysis

**Option A: Single-Failure Escalation** (current):
- Cost: $4.42/year
- Problem: Aggressive, wastes GPT-5 on retryable errors

**Option B: 2-Attempt Retry** (RECOMMENDED):
- Cost: $5.20/year (+18%)
- Benefit: Catches flaky tests, deterministic failures escalate immediately
- Industry precedent: GitHub Copilot Workspace, Cursor AI

**Option C: Confidence-Based** (over-engineered):
- Cost: $5.50/year (+25%)
- Problem: Requires AI confidence scoring infrastructure

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Option B (2-Attempt Retry)** - +$0.78/year justified for reliability

## Question 3: Linear Integration Depth

**Your question**: "can we go deeper to do things like - assign projects to certain errors and certain extensions? I.e. only PaletteKit errors go to the PaletteKit Linear project?"

### Answer: ‚úÖ Already Designed for Extension-Specific Routing

**Good news**: The planned Linear integration ALREADY does this via label-based routing!

### How It Works

**1. Error Logger Labels Issues**:
```javascript
// shared/error-logger.js
async function reportToGitHub(error, extensionId) {
  const labels = [`extension:${extensionId}`, 'error:runtime'];

  await octokit.issues.create({
    owner: 'littlebearapps',
    repo: 'homeostat',
    title: error.message,
    body: error.stack,
    labels: labels  // e.g., ['extension:palettekit', 'error:runtime']
  });
}
```

**2. Webhook Routes to Correct Linear Project**:
```javascript
// worker/linear-webhook.js
const routingMap = {
  'extension:notebridge': { team: 'EXT', project: 'notebridge' },
  'extension:palettekit': { team: 'EXT', project: 'palettekit' },
  'extension:convertmyfile': { team: 'EXT', project: 'convertmyfile' },
  'homeostat': { team: 'SYS', project: 'infrastructure' }
};

async function handleGitHubWebhook(issue) {
  // Find first matching label
  const label = issue.labels.find(l => routingMap[l.name]);
  const route = routingMap[label.name];

  // Create Linear issue in correct project
  await linearClient.createIssue({
    teamId: route.team,
    projectId: route.project,
    title: issue.title,
    description: `GitHub: ${issue.html_url}\n\n${issue.body}`
  });
}
```

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **No changes needed** - routing is already extension-specific

---

## Question 4: GitHub Projects vs Linear

**Your question**: "would github projects be better for our use case, or is Linear the way to go? For transparency, I am already set up with Linear, but if there are massive benefits to moving to GitHub Projects for all of this, I will absolutely consider"

### Answer: ‚úÖ GitHub Projects via gh CLI - FINAL DECISION

**üéØ UPDATE (2025-10-23 - Final Decision)**:

After realizing that:
- Linear integration requires **3-4 hours** (webhook handler, sync logic, mapping DB)
- GitHub Projects via gh CLI requires **0 hours** (just use `gh project` commands)
- **No MCP server needed** - Just use gh CLI directly!

**Decision**: Use GitHub Projects with gh CLI (see implementation examples below)

---

### Cost Comparison (5 Years)

| Platform | Year 1 | Year 5 | Total 5-Year | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| **GitHub Projects** | $0 | $0 | **$0** | Included in Team plan |
| **Linear Basic** | $384 | $422 | **$2,200** | $8/user/month, 10% annual increase |
| **Linear Business** | $672 | $739 | **$3,850** | $14/user/month, 10% annual increase |

**Savings**: $2,200-3,850 over 5 years by using GitHub Projects

### Recommendation

‚úÖ **Use GitHub Projects** for Homeostat because:

1. **Zero marginal cost** - Already paying for Team plan
2. **Native integration** - No sync code, fewer bugs
3. **Sufficient features** - Homeostat is API-driven (UI speed irrelevant)
4. **Simpler architecture** - One API token, no bidirectional sync
5. **Solo developer workflow** - Don't need Cycles (sprint planning)

**Linear is better ONLY for**: Teams needing sprint planning, complex roadmaps with 10+ projects, or who highly value UI speed for daily PM work

**Migration time**: 0 hours (just use gh CLI) vs 3-4 hours to build Linear integration = saves 3-4 hours

## Question 5: DeepSeek/GPT-5 API Security & Privacy

**Your question**: "are there any security/privacy concerns giving one or both of these APIs access to our codebases etc?"

### Answer: ‚ö†Ô∏è SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY GAP BETWEEN APIS

See complete analysis in `PRIVACY-SECURITY-GUIDE.md`

**Summary**:
- **GPT-5**: ‚úÖ Acceptable risk (30-day retention, no training data usage, SOC 2 certified)
- **DeepSeek**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant risk (indefinite retention, used for training, China jurisdiction)

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Tiered Privacy Strategy**
- Sensitive files ‚Üí GPT-5 only (never DeepSeek)
- Generic errors ‚Üí DeepSeek (with PII sanitization)
- All API calls ‚Üí PII redaction (extension IDs, paths, API keys, emails, JWTs)

**Cost**: $8.50/year (+6% vs original)
**Privacy**: 9.5/10 rating

## Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 0: Core Privacy & Security (MUST DO FIRST)
**Timeline**: Week 1-2 (8-10 hours)

**Deliverables**:
1. PII Sanitization Engine (`shared/privacy/sanitizer.js`)
2. Sensitive File Detection (`homeostat/config/sensitive-files.js`)
3. Model Selection Logic (`homeostat/routing/model-selector.js`)
4. Retry Logic with Deterministic Detection (`homeostat/execution/retry-handler.js`)

**Why first**: Privacy and reliability are non-negotiable foundations

---

### Phase 1: GitHub Projects Integration (RECOMMENDED)
**Timeline**: Week 3 (0 hours - just use gh CLI!)

**Deliverables**:
1. Create 3 GitHub Projects (NoteBridge, PaletteKit, ConvertMyFile)
2. Configure automation (auto-add issues with labels)
3. Use gh CLI commands in GitHub Actions

**Why now**: Zero dev time, zero ongoing cost

---

### Phase 2: Homeostat Core (EXISTING PLAN)
**Timeline**: Week 4-6 (22-31 hours)

**Deliverables**: Per docs/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Complexity analyzer (now with retry logic from Phase 0)
